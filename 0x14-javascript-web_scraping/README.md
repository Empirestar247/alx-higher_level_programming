## What is JavaScript - Web scraping

JavaScript is a widely-used programming language that is primarily used for creating dynamic, interactive, and responsive web pages. It is commonly used in web development to add interactivity, validate user input, and manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM), which represents the structure and content of a web page.

## Web scraping, on the other hand, is the process of extracting data from websites. This data can be in the form of text, images, tables, or any other content that is publicly accessible on a website. Web scraping is often used for various purposes, including data mining, price comparison, content aggregation, and more.
