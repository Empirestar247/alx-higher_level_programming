#0x0B. Python - Input/Output

In Python, you can use the input() function to accept user input and the print() function to display output to the console. Here's an example:

# Accepting user input
name = input("Enter your name: ")
age = input("Enter your age: ")

# Displaying output
print("Hello, " + name + "! You are " + age + " years old.")


When you run this code and execute it, it will prompt the user to enter their name and age. After the user enters the values, the program will display a message with the entered name and age.

Remember that the input() function always returns a string, so if you need to work with numerical values, you may need to convert the input using functions like int() or float(). Here's an example:

# Accepting a number from the user
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))

# Performing a calculation
result = num * 2

# Displaying the result
print("The result is:", result)


In this example, the user is asked to enter a number. The input is converted to an integer using the int() function, and then it's multiplied by 2. Finally, the result is displayed using the print() function.
